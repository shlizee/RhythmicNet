"""Adaptation from magenta/note_seq/drums_lib.py
Utility functions for working with drums.
Use extract_drum_tracks to extract drum tracks from a quantized NoteSequence.

    """Stores a quantized stream of drum events.
  DrumTrack is an intermediate representation that all drum models can use.
  Quantized sequence to DrumTrack code will do work to align drum notes and
  extract drum tracks. Model-specific code then needs to convert DrumTrack
  to SequenceExample protos for TensorFlow.
  DrumTrack implements an iterable object. Simply iterate to retrieve the drum
  events.
  DrumTrack events are Numpy arrays of simultaneous MIDI drum "pitches",
  where each pitch indicates a type of drum. An empty Numpy array indicates no
  drum notes. Unlike melody notes, drum notes are not considered to have
  durations.
  Drum tracks can start at any non-negative time, and are shifted left so that
  the bar containing the first drum event is the first bar.
  Attributes:
    start_step: The offset of the first step of the drum track relative to the
        beginning of the source sequence. Will always be the first step of a
        bar.
    end_step: The offset to the beginning of the bar following the last step
       of the drum track relative the beginning of the source sequence. Will
       always be the first step of a bar.
    steps_per_quarter: Number of steps in in a quarter note.
    steps_per_bar: Number of steps in a bar (measure) of music.
